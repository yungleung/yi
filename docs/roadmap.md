# Roadmap

What is planned next, and what is closed, in the order the phase handoffs left it.
Every line names the handoff it comes from; numbers are from the probes named in
those handoffs, on the 323 KB fixture note's last block (4760 characters, 189
elements) unless it says otherwise.

## Closed

- **A piece table for the text** (P5's first follow-on). Landed in P6:
  `document/text_store.ts` is the text, `getText()` materialises a version.
- **The plain keystroke's parse** (P7's "the parse"). Landed in P9: a plain
  keystroke asks the block's parse for nothing; the deferred check parses once a
  burst, and the ordinary path parses what it renders. A plain keystroke went from
  11 ms to 4 ms.
- **Virtualising inside a block** (P6's fourth item). Its goal is met without its
  mechanism: that block costs 4 ms per plain keystroke against 36–40 ms before P7,
  with no rebuild. Chunking inside a block stays out, for the reasons in P7 §1.4 (a
  block is one unit of layout: line boxes, one `<ul>`, one `<table>`). It would need
  a new motive — a single block too large even to write into cheaply.
- **Spaces in the plain-edit rule.** Landed in P10: a space between two words is
  written like a letter — 4 ms on that block against 40 ms before, with one geometry
  read — because the rule now looks at the runs on *both* sides of the edit (a space
  glued to a URL's left turns it into an autolink) and refuses a run of two spaces.
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-23-spaces-in-plain-edits.md` has the numbers and
  the cases that stay refused: a destination, a label, a line edge, a marker.
- **Undo ergonomics** (P5's second and third follow-ons). Landed in P12: an edit
  carries the caret it started from and the one it left, so undo returns to where the
  author was; and a run of typing or deleting is one step, with a letter (`\p{L}`, any
  script's) as the step boundary and `STEP_LIMIT` as the cap for scripts that write no
  spaces. `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-undo-ergonomics.md` has the rule.
- **A line index for the text (lazy block offsets).** Landed in P11, as a block
  offset index rather than a line index — the measurement showed the string
  materialisation P6 worried about is free (V8 hands back a sliced string) and the
  cost was `blocks.ts: moved()`, which rewrote every block below the edit: **484 of
  484 blocks for a character typed at the top** of the fixture note, against a
  handful now, and the count no longer grows with the document (2 of 1933 in a note
  four times as long). The wall clock at this size is inside the probe's noise; this
  was the last O(blocks)-per-keystroke shape, and the win is the shape.

## Open, in the order to take them

1. **The footnote gap.** A footnote reference cannot be clicked into and edited —
   a click routes to the jump. A small feature of its own, not a rendering question.

## Measure before deciding

- **The ordinary path's parse.** A structural keystroke still parses the block it
  rebuilds (9 ms of its ~40 ms). Spaces no longer reach it, punctuation and digits
  still do, and making the parse itself cheaper is a parser measurement, not a caret
  one.
- **Deriving the parse for a plain edit.** Possible — the new tree is the old one
  with the positions moved and one leaf rewritten — but it would put trees in the
  parse cache that the parser did not produce, and the deferred check would then
  have to parse freshly to stay a check. No keystroke this thread does not already
  free.
- **The deferred check's parse** (once a burst; 9 ms for that block) is the safety
  net's price, not a defect.
